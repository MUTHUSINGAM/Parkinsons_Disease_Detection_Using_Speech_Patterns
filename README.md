## 🎯 Project Overview

This project utilizes **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to detect Parkinson’s Disease from voice recordings. It processes **biomedical voice features** like MFCCs, Chroma, Mel Spectrogram, and Spectral Contrast to classify audio samples into *Healthy* or *Parkinson's Disease*. The model is deployed with **Streamlit** for user-friendly predictions.

### 🚀 Key Features
✔️ **Biomedical voice analysis for accurate Parkinson’s detection**  
✔️ **Neural network-based classification model** for high precision  
✔️ **Feature extraction using MFCC, Chroma, Mel Spectrogram, and Spectral Contrast**  
✔️ **User-friendly web interface for uploading audio or recording speech**  
✔️ **Real-time prediction of Parkinson’s Disease presence**

## 📊 Parkinson's Detection Workflow

### 🔍 1. Data Collection
- Voice samples from **healthy individuals** and **Parkinson’s patients** are stored in separate directories.
- The dataset is sourced from research databases or clinical recordings.

### 🔬 2. Feature Extraction
- Extract **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**, **Chroma**, **Mel Spectrogram**, and **Spectral Contrast**.
- Features are **flattened and padded** to a fixed size.
- Standardized using **scikit-learn’s StandardScaler**.

### 🤖 3. Model Training
- A **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** with 4 hidden layers is trained.
- Uses **Batch Normalization, Dropout, and ReLU activation**.
- Optimized using **Adam optimizer** with **binary cross-entropy loss**.

### ✅ 4. Model Testing & Evaluation
- Evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Trained model is stored and used for predictions.

### 📌 5. Real-Time Prediction (Streamlit Interface)
- **Upload an audio file** (wav, mp3, flac) to get a prediction.
- **Record live speech** using a microphone for diagnosis.
- **Outputs “Healthy” or “Parkinson Present”** based on model inference.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### 1️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
```sh
streamlit run main.py  
```

### 2️⃣ Upload an Audio File or Record Speech
- Click the **“Choose an audio file”** button to upload a recording.
- Click **“Click to Record Speech”** to record live voice.
- The model will predict whether Parkinson’s Disease is present.
